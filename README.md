Garlic bread for life!

Reddit Garlic Robot is a redditbot made in December 2017 and is a parody of Reddit Silver Robot, itself a parody of Reddit's built in "Reddit Gold". Reddit gold is a paid service to show appreciation of another users work on the site. The bot in this project does the same thing on a smaller scale: tells a user it is worthy of receiving garlic bread, the highest of all achievments

The mechanics of the bot are simple. You may summon the bot with "!RedditGarlic" in a comment, and it will respond with a link to the RedditGarlic picture, as well as keep track of how many times each user has given or recieved Reddit Garlic.
